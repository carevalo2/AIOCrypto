# AIOCrypto

---

A Discord bot written in discord.py that focuses on cryptocurrency. Uses MVC structure.
It has the ability to fetch prices, and soon will be able to track
transactions. Currently supports three coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

Prices are fetched using the CoinMarketCap API.
